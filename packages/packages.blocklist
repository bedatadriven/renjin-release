# These packages cannot be built with Renjin because 
# of a dependency on an external native library, or someother reason.

# If they are "suggested" by other packages, they will be excluded from the 
# package graph, but if they are required, then they will be built, but without the
# native compilation or configure step.

  
# Wrappers for crypto libraries

# The following are graphics-related packages
